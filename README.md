## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Revisited Flexbox and how to make a sticky footer with it;
I used flexbox maybe too much here but with this simple design I thing grid would be overkill;
I didn't use any responsive layout. The card is 320px wide and looks good on the smallest device, I think;


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Great resource for HTML and CSS references
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Great thing to ask questions about some tricky situations but you shouldn't rely on it too much for learning purposes
